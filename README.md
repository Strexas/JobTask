main.py solve task by using built-ins unstuments, please point out max_depth parameter to see other result


main2.py solve task by using my own Octree algorithm, it runs much slower than main.py (15 minutes if max_depth=10).

If you already want to see the result from main2.py, open .png file. (max_depth=10)
